            We're glad you made it here and hope you're hungry for new flavors.
            Our pizza is made with passion and attention to details, starting
            from choosing the best ingredients to controlling the temperature in
            the oven. We're sure you'll love our specialties and want to come
            back for more, even if you don't like pizza (you sure you're human?
            it doesn't matter, you're welcome anyway)
          </p>
